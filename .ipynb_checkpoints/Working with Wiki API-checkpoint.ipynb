The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. He managed the company until [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|his 2017 inauguration]].

His campaign received extensive [[earned media|free media]] coverage.

Trump [[Veracity of statements by Donald Trump|has made many false or misleading statements]] during his campaign and presidency.

He [[Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act|partially repealed]] the [[Dodd-Frank Act]] that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the [[2008 financial crisis]]. He has pursued his [[America First (policy)|America First]] agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] trade negotiations, the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change, and the [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]].

[[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|The investigation]] led to guilty pleas by five Trump associates to [[Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|criminal charges]] including lying to investigators, campaign finance violations, and tax fraud.
